### Q1. Types of Testing

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- End-to-End Testing (e2e testing)

  **Unit Testing**
  - Unit Testing is a fundamental aspect of software testing
    where individual components or functions of an application
    are tested in isolation.
  - This method ensures that each unit of the application
    performs as expected.
  - By focusing on small, manageable parts of the application,
    unit testing helps identify and fix bugs early in the
    development process, significantly improving code quality
    and reliability.
  - Unit tests are typically automated and written by
    developers.

  **Integration Testing**
  - Integration testing is a software testing process where
    software components, modules, or units are tested to
    evaluate system compliance concerning functional
    requirements.
  - This testing phase is crucial to ensure seamless interactions
    among various units/components, their functionalities and
    how well they can operate as a single entity.

  **End-to-End Testing**
  - In e2e testing, the application is tested from the moment
    the user starts using the application to the moment user
    leaves the application.
  - In this testing, we test the complete flow of the application
    from beginning to the end.
