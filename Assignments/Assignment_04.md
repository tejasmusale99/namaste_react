### Q1. Is JSX mandatory for React?
- No, JSX is not a requirement for using React.
- Using React without JSX is especially convenient when you donâ€™t want to set up compilation in your build environment.
- Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children).
- So, anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript!

### Q2. Is ES6 mandatory for React?
- Nope! You can technically build React apps without ES6, but highly recommended. Most libraries & resources assume it, and code becomes cleaner & more concise.

### Q3. How to add comments in JSX?
- You'll need to use JavaScript comments inside of JSX.
- You can use regular /* Block Comments */, but they need to be wrapped in curly braces: {/* A JSX comment */}

### Q4. React Fragment vs <></> 
- Both <React.Fragment> and <> are ways to group children in React without adding an extra DOM element.
- They're helpful for avoiding unnecessary nesting and keeping JSX code clean.
- Think of them as invisible wrappers! <React.Fragment> is the explicit way, while <> is a shorthand introduced in React 16.6. Both achieve the same outcome.
