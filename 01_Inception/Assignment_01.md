# Homework Questions

## Assignment 1

### 1. What is Emmet?

- Emmet is a plugin built into most code editors (like VS Code, Sublime, Atom).

- It helps you write HTML and CSS faster by using short abbreviations that expand into full code.

- **Example:** typing ! in an HTML file and pressing Tab/Enter generates a complete HTML boilerplate.

### 2. Difference between a Library and Framework?

- **Library** → You control the flow. You pick and call functions when needed.

  - **Example**: **React** (**Programmer** Decide decide how to use components).

- **Framework** → It controls the flow. You just fill in the parts; the framework decides when to call your code.

  - **Example**: **Angular** (**Framework** provides structure and calls your code at the right time).

## Analogy

**Library** = Ordering food → you choose what you want.

**Framework** = Going to a buffet → structure is already set, you follow it.
